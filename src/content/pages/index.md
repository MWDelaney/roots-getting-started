title: Getting Started with Roots Sage, Trellis, and Bedrock
---

Getting started with the [Roots](https://roots.io) can be challenging if you haven't worked with its core technologies before. If you're new to software like [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com), [yarn](https://npmjs.com), and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), these tools might not be installed on your computer yet. This website exists to act as a "step zero" to the [official Roots documentation](https://docs.roots.io).

## What operating system are you using?

* [macOS](/macos/)
* [Ubuntu Linux](/ubuntu-linux/)
* [Windows (WSL)](/windows/)
